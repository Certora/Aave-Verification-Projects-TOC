# Aave-Certora Partnership Overview
This repository functions as a table of content for every project Certora were involved in within the Aave ecosystem.

## Finding Our Work
All of our work can be found within the linked repositories.

In general, we try to contain all our work into 1 directory called "certora", however, occasionally reports and some of our work is placed in another directory, so if you can find a "certora" directory try to look around in security related directories

- Reports can usually be found under a directory called "audit", "security", or within "certora/reports".

- Specifications can usually be found under the "certora/specs" directory.

- additional settings, assumptions, mocking, etc. can also be found under the relevant sub directory within "certora" - "certora/scripts", "certora/conf", "certora/harness", etc.
